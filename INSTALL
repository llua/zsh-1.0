I was not able to port zsh to many platforms because I don't have
accounts on many platforms.  It shouldn't be too much trouble if you
manage to decipher my code.  I have tested zsh on SunOS 4.1, SunOS 4.0.3,
4.3BSD UNIX.

You need to edit the files config.h, config.local.h, makefile, and
readline/Makefile.  The comments should make clear what you have to do.
Note that the files in the readline directory have been greatly
modified, so you can't just copy over your changes from bash if you
have it installed.

Once you have done that, you might be able to do a make without any
problem.  If you have trouble, and can't get zsh to work, send me mail,
and I'll try to help.  If anyone manages to get zsh ported to some other
platform, please mail me so I can tell other people about your changes
and incorporate them into the next version.
